This is exponential S-box investigation based on work of S. Agievich and A. Afonenko (https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/024). The main  purpose of the app
is to study cryptographical characteristics of exponential S-boxes when we apply the Affine transformation on entrance or on exit of ususal exponential S-box. This app build for all of S-boxes different differential distribution tables, linear approximaton tables, and a few more a little bit more complex charachteristics. 
Also it builds charts for statistics: amount of exponent for each of maximums in tables(it finds max in table for each S-box and count the amount of basises for exp S-box with such maximum)
